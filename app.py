**Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

- **Time Complexity ‚Äì O(V + E)**  
  1. We visit every vertex (node) at most once, marking it as visited.  
  2. For each visited vertex, we inspect all its outgoing edges exactly once.  
  3. Summing over all vertices and edges yields O(V + E), where V = number of vertices and E = number of edges.

- **Space Complexity ‚Äì O(V)**  
  1. We maintain a `visited` set of size up to V.  
  2. We maintain a queue that can hold up to O(V) vertices in the worst-case.  
  3. Storing the graph itself (adjacency lists) is also O(V + E), but usually we consider just the additional data structures: visited set + queue = **O(V)**.

---

**Depth-First Search (DFS):**

- **Time Complexity ‚Äì O(V + E)**  
  1. Similar to BFS, each vertex is visited once and each edge is explored once in the recursion/stack process.  
  2. Therefore, total time is O(V + E).

- **Space Complexity ‚Äì O(V)**  
  1. We maintain a `visited` set of up to V elements.  
  2. We use an explicit or implicit stack (in our implementation, a list is used as a stack).  
  3. In the worst case (a path of length V), the stack can hold up to V frames if the graph is a linear chain.  
  4. Hence additional space = visited set + stack = **O(V)**.

---

### How These Measures Were Determined:

- **BFS (O(V + E) time):**  
  1. We begin from a start node, enqueue it, and mark as visited.  
  2. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node, then enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors.  
  3. Each edge is enqueued (i.e., considered) at most once, and each vertex is dequeued/visited exactly once.  
  4. Thus, scanning adjacency lists over the entire run costs O(V + E).

- **DFS (O(V + E) time):**  
  1. We use a stack (or recursive calls) to explore as deeply as possible before backtracking.  
  2. Each vertex is pushed onto the stack and popped once; each edge is examined once when exploring neighbors.  
  3. Hence O(V + E) in total.

- **Space (O(V) for both):**  
  - The `visited` set holds up to V vertices.  
  - The queue (BFS) or stack (DFS) can hold up to O(V) in the worst-case (for example, a wide level in BFS or a long path in DFS).  
  - We ignore the O(V + E) for storing the original graph (adjacency list) because that is input size, not additional auxiliary space.

> **Note:**  
> - If the graph is extremely sparse or extremely dense, the O(V + E) bound still applies.  
> - In a directed graph, E counts directed edges. In an undirected graph, each undirected edge is counted twice in adjacency lists, but the time complexity remains O(V + E).
